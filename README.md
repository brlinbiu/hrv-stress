# Using Heart-Rate Variability to Determine Stress Levels
Discuss whether heartrate variability relate to stress level or not.

## Simple Intro

Stress is a big problem in today's society. Therefore, being able to measure pressure may help solve this problem. Although stress comes from psychology, studies have shown that it affects several physiological processes in the human body. Such as increased tension in the neck muscles, changes in hormone concentration, changes in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), etc. The brain stimulates the heart through the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. Sympathetic nerve activity leads to an increase in heart rate. Based on this conjecture, the author designed an experiment on whether pressure affects HRV and how to use HRV for pressure measurement. 

The experiment is mainly divided into two aspects: data collection and data analysis. After data collection, analyze the data source and test the normal distribution of the experimental data. If it meets the characteristics of the normal distribution, then proceed to the next step. In the stage of data analysis, among several existing HRV measurement methods, select several for data classification. Among these several measurement methods, they are roughly divided into two types, time domain and frequency domain. Finally, make a summary based on the results of the data analysis. The conclusion is that although it cannot be concluded in this experiment that the HRV measurement method has the ability to accurately measure pressure, several of the measurement methods can reflect that HRV is affected by pressure.
